# dotfiles
My configuration for bash, vim, git, tmux and a few other tools. Tested on OS X and Debian Linux.

To use them run `make` in the cloned git repository. If you are on OS X you should also install the included font to take full advantage of the tmux status line.

**Caution: This will overwrite your stuff! Seriously â€“ you have been warned!**

To use git you will probably want to create the file `~/.gitconfig.local` and add your name and email address:
```
[user]
  name = Jeff Strongman
  email = jeff@example.org
```
